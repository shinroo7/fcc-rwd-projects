# Responsive Web Design @ freeCodeCamp.org

In this [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/shinroo/responsive-web-design), I've learnt the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

At the end of the course, I got a chance to apply all of the skills, principles, and concepts I have learned by complete the five web programming projects.
